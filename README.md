# Booklist
A small javascript project where we can add a book, delete it and store it in localstorage

Stack used: HTML,CSS and javascript

DEMO: https://rupeshpra22.github.io/Booklist/

I have followed this video for this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMCxVWtW58

Things that i learned from this project:

Object Oriented Programming in javascript

Use of classes and static methods in javascript

Other than following the video, below are the feature implemented by me:

1: In the video, bootstrap is used for styling, i have used pure CSS and made the application responsive.

2: When there is no book information in a table, displayed 'Hey! Add a book and see your book listed here' on the table.

Cheers!!!
